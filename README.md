# ProgDA-assignment
This repository is for an assignment for Programming for Data Analysis in GMIT 2019.

The Assignment instructions:

"The following assignment concerns the numpy.random package in Python [2]. You are required to create a Jupyter [5] notebook explaining the use of the package, including detailed explanations of at least five of the distributions provided for in the package.
There are four distinct tasks to be carried out in your Jupyter notebook.
1. Explain the overall purpose of the package.
2. Explain the use of the “Simple random data” and “Permutations” functions.
3. Explain the use and purpose of at least five “Distributions” functions.
4. Explain the use of seeds in generating pseudorandom numbers."
